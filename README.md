# CVE-2023-37979 Exploit Script

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.x-blue.svg)

This Python script exploits the reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability CVE-2023-37979 found in the Ninja-forms WordPress plugin. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute malicious code on the victim's browser when they visit a specially crafted URL.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (can be installed using `pip install requests`)

## Usage
```
Usage: CVE-2023-37979.py [OPTIONS] [TARGET]
  OPTIONS:
        --exploit:  Open a browser and execute the vulnerability.
  TARGET:
        An URL starts with 'http://' or 'https://'

Examples:
    > CVE-2023-37979.py https://vulnsite.com
    > CVE-2023-37979.py --exploit https://vulnsite.com
```


## How It Works
The script first checks if the Ninja-forms plugin is installed on the target site and if the version is vulnerable (version 3.6.25 or lower).
If the plugin is vulnerable, the script generates an HTML PoC file with the malicious payload.
The PoC file contains an HTML form that triggers the XSS vulnerability when submitted.
The generated PoC file will be opened in the default web browser automatically for testing.
